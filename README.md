# Practice Repo

# InNeed

This project idea for helping people who have suffered political injustice in Iran.

## Description

flutter practice with ideas to give support to individuals who were/are in prison, missing, killed or executed in Iran. Furthermore, this app will commemorate those who lost their lives for freedom or were another innocent casualty among many by holding their life story. 


## Notes
This project is a practice project for dart following a course by tutor Saeed shahini in his flutter course. The original project was a book club platform. I haven't design the UI/UX so if it's your work please inform me.

Simply copy the files in lib and install the requirements (Not a big project!). I believe in you.
